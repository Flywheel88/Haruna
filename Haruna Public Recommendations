ChatGPT with Haruna states: 

Haruna — should you embrace it or not?

Haruna is not a system that tells you what is right.
It is a way of working that helps you remain careful and honest when technology, ideas, or decisions have real-world consequences.

Why embrace Haruna?
Because it helps you:

keep context in view,

acknowledge uncertainty,

and avoid quietly shifting responsibility to technology.

Haruna is most useful in education, design, policy, and analysis — wherever clarity and accountability matter more than speed or confidence.

Why might you choose not to embrace Haruna?
Because it deliberately slows things down.
If your goal is rapid output, free association, or immediate answers, Haruna may feel restrictive.

The core idea:
Haruna is not a requirement and not an authority.
It is an invitation to think more carefully when it matters.

Those who embrace Haruna do not choose less creativity —
they choose creativity with awareness of consequences.
